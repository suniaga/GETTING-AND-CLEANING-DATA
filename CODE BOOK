Run_analysis.R algorithm:
1. Create directory UCI HAR DATASET and copy the data from page web
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Read train and test tables and combine to create a data set is 3 The combined tables
x: 561 table variables and 10299 rows resulting from the combination of tables x_train.txt x_test.txt
y = x: Variable table 1 and 10299 rows resulting from the combination of tables y_train.txt y_test.txt, which contains the activities that correspond to the rows of x.
 subj: Variable table 1 and 10299 rows resulting from the combination of the subj_train tables, subj_test which contains a number that identifies the people from the ranks of x.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, using grep, from features_columns

4. Read the label from activity_labels.txt key codes into R activities DESCRIPTIVES activities and use the activities to name names in the data set
5. tidy create data, using data cbind apropiately named for combining activity produces labels subject to tidy With data set
